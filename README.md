# OpenGallery
OpenGallery is an easy way to share photos and small videos with your friends and colleagues without loosing meta-data or image-quality of these.

## Idea
It was originally designed to collect images from trips with friends at one place. We had the issue that you lose a lot of meta-data when you share your images via whatsapp or similar services.
For example you loose the date, when the photo was taken and maybe the GPS-information to. To prevent these issues I started developing this site and there is still a lot of work to do to make this site better suited for this purpose than dropbox, gdrive or other filehosters are.

## Demo
You can checkout the live [demo](https://gallery.hackedit.de) with secret code `demo` (or [click here](https://gallery.hackedit.de?a=demo) ) But I've disabled the upload function.
